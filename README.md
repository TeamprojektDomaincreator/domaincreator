## Overview

Domaincreator parses all line entities from a DXF file to identify the outer domain of the drawing, consolidates lines within this domain into their largest polygons, and classifies these as "objects" in eFlow terms. The output is a `.json` file in eFlow format, which can be uploaded to the Flowculate program for further use.
